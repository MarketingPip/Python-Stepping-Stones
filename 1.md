```py

## First we make a list of numbers.. 

my_list = ['1', '5']


## Second we start the number at 0 
number = 0


## then we make a loop... 


## You can define whatever name you would like to call a item in list 
## example - for x in my_list - in this example below. We have called it simply "item"
### you should define your items / variables & any code neatly so you can later reflect on
## it, make changes easier to it and so other developers can understand it easily! 

for item in my_list:
   number+= int(item)



## Then we print the final output
print(number)


### using a list is great, but should be used for a larger set of items.. Notice we can
## achieve the same results simply by adding two "variables"


first_number = 1 ## this is a variable < not a list! 
second_number = 5 ## this is a variable < not a list! 

print(first_number + second_number)

## A variable can be integer or a string

## what is a "string" a string is simply text... Don't ask why it's called string.. 
## we all don't know.........    

```
